# Use All Races

Use all races in every settlement instead of just 3. Works with custom races

Adds a few extra configs to the game to allow you to choose which races you want to play with and how many will appear in the game.

NOTE: If you install the [API mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/against-the-storm/p/ATS_API_Devs/API/) then the configs will appear in the options menu.
